D)  I really like the explosions in Just Cause 3. So basically what
happend pre- explosion is there is like a leak and you can see the
gas coming out, it even looks kind of wavy where the gas is leaking 
(kind of like how the streets look when it's really hot and it appears
like they are waving back and forth from afar). Then the actual explosion
happens either with time or the player expedites the process. When the 
explosion happens, the way it moves looks pretty real and it looks 
cool the way they made the explosion flash, as if there are still things
inside the chaos that are yet to explode and are still exploding. 
Then there is also shrapnel thrown everywehre and once the explosion calms 
all that is left is the black smoke that slowly disappears. I have no
clue as to how is was created but I feel like it was a particle system,
especially the smoke. The effect doesn't really change as the camera 
moves but since the explosion displaces randomly, seeing it from a 
different angle can give you a different view. I think the effect
definitely changes the color of the pixles because it goes from a 
firey explosion to just black smoke. I think it also alters the texture
since it goes from like ried, orange, yellow flames + smoke to
only smoke.
